# ðŸ›’ Shopping Cart Price Calculator

## ðŸ“– Project Description

The **Shopping Cart Price Calculator** is a Java EE web application designed to calculate the final cost of a user's purchase based on form input. This includes computing subtotal, tax, and shipping fees dynamically, depending on user-specified values such as item quantity, price per item, tax rate, and shipping province.

The project integrates **client-side validation** using JavaScript with **server-side processing** via Java servlets and JSPs to ensure both a responsive user experience and secure backend logic. It demonstrates proper separation of concerns, input validation, dynamic content rendering, and the use of web deployment descriptors (`web.xml`) for default configurations.

This application can serve as a foundation for understanding full-stack web application development in Java EE, including servlet logic, JSP/JSPX templating, and front-end form validation.
